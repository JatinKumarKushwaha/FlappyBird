# Flappy Bird
The good old classic flappy bird, written in Python, using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org)

All artwork is done by me.

# Dependencies
[PYgame](https://www.pygame.org) 2.5.2 (SDL 2.28.2, Python 3.10.12)

# How to run
Just download the repository and run the script or if you are on Windows just download the zip file with the game from the releases page. It may be detected as a virus but I am pretty sure it's not. I used [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) to bundle it, if you are not sure just download the repository and the install the required libraries and run the game using Python.

```
python main.py
```
