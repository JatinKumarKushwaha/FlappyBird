# Flappy Bird
The good old flappy bird, now with an online multiplayer, made with Python, using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org)

# Dependencies
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) 2.6.1 (SDL 2.28.4, Python 3.12.3)

# How to run
Just download the repository and run the script or if you are on Windows just download the zip file with the game from the [releases page](https://github.com/JatinKumarKushwaha/FlappyBird/releases). It may be detected as a virus but I am pretty sure it's not. I used [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) to bundle it, if you are not sure just download the repository and then install the required libraries and run the game using Python.

```
python main.py
```
